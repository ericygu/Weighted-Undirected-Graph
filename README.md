# Weighted-Undirected-Graph

Wote a program to process a weighted undirected graph that:
1. Reads in the number of vertices V and the number of edges E of the graph followed by its
E edges, each in the form u, v, w where 1 <= u, v <= V & w > 0 representing an edge (u,
v) with weight w.

2. Sets up and prints the adjacency matrix representation of the graph.

3. Determines how many connected components the graph has and print each component in
adjacency list representation.

4. Uses Prim Algorithms to find a minimum spanning tree for each component and print
the adjacency matrix representation of the minimum spanning forest (the union of the
minimum spanning trees of the components).
